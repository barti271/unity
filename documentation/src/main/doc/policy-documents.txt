== Policy documents and agreements

Unity supports management and presentation of various policy documents like terms of use (ToU), EULA, marketing agreements 
and similar.

Documents are defined centrally in Admin Console -> Settings -> Policy documents. Documents are versioned, 
can be mandatory or optional. Documents may be also stored externally, or embedded.

Once a policy document is defined it can be used in various places of the system:

* In registration forms, to show agreement as a part of new user signup.
* In enquiry forms, to selectively prompt users to agree on a document.
* On Identity Provider endpoints, to show policy document acceptance view as a part of login flow,
from a service using Unity as an IdP.

In each case Unity stores result of policy acceptance (or disagreement, possible in case of optional documents) 
as an attribute of a user who took action on document. Such attribute can be viewed among regular attributes 
of the user.

Admin Console permits for changes of the document with and without revision change.    
User who has accepted a policy document won't be presented with it again, until it is modified with revision change. 
In other words update of a policy document will require re-confirmation only when document revision is increased.
