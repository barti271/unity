=== Web Admin UI endpoint (deprecated)

Endpoint type:: +WebAdminUI+
Binding:: Web
Exposed paths:: +/admin+
Default path:: +/admin+

Web Admin UI is a legacy administrative interface, a predecessor of Admin Console. This endpoint is going to be dropped in one 
subsequent releases, so switching to Admin Console is highly suggested. Admin Console offers a better and more capable UI.
