=== Web Admin Console endpoint

Endpoint type:: +WebConsoleUI+
Binding:: Web
Exposed paths:: +/console+
Default path:: +/console+

Web Admin Console is the first place to visit after server installation and startup as it offers
an administrator oriented management interface. 
By default it is accessible under the link: +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT/console]+  
or simply +pass:[https://localhost:2443/ENDPOINT-CONFIGURED-CONTEXT]+ as the +/console+ path is the default.

The features of the Console interface are covered in the <<contents-management>> section.

Currently the Admin Console endpoint offers only options common for all web endpoints.
