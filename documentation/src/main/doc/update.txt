== Update

This section covers a general update procedure. Make sure to read version specific update instruction too: 
<<ver-update>>. If you are updating with a revision release (change of the version number after the last dot only, 
e.g. 1.3.0 -> 1.3.1 or 9.11.2 -> 9.11.5) you can skip to the simplified <<revision-update>> instruction.

The update is a potentially dangerous operation, therefore we suggest to take two precautions:

. *MANDATORY* make a full database backup _before_ starting the update.
. *SUGGESTED* make a test drive. To do this you need a separate instance of Unity service, with database copied from 
the production one. Update it first and only if everything goes OK, proceed with an update of the production instance.

After the precautions are done the update instructions are following.

When using the +.tar.gz+: 

. Install the updated version in a separate directory as in the case of a fresh installation.
. Configure it with the settings of the running instance. Copy the config files of the old version and 
(if required) made any version specific modifications which are given below. 
. Stop the old service.
. Start the new instance.
. Carefully check log files for any errors or warnings.
. If needed reconfigure startup scripts to start the updated service, as well as update the +PATH+ variable to use
new Unity binaries location. It is a good practice to have a symbolic link to the actual Unity installation directory
that is used in the +PATH+ and startup scripts. Then it is possible to simply change its target to the updated 
service directory.

If using the RPM: 

. Stop the old service.
. Update the RPM using platform tools (usually +yum+).
. Check if any configuration files needs to be updated (see below, also search for +.rpmnew+ files in /etc/unity-idm).
. Start the new service.
. Carefully check log files for any errors or warnings.

[NOTE] 
The database dump can be created and loaded from the Web Admin UI, from the _Server maintenance_ tab. It can be used 
to transfer the Unity state between instances, can be also used as a backup tool. However in the upgrade case
it is strongly suggested to make a regular database dump.

[[revision-update]]
=== Revision (bugfix) update

From time to time a revision version of Unity is released. Such version is marked with a change of the last 
number in the distribution version only. When installing such revision release a simplified procedure can be
taken. Database backup is advised as always, though in revision update the risk is minimal - revision releases
typically do not introduce database changes.
  
When using the +.tar.gz+: 

. Unpack the updated release
. Stop the server
. Replace the contents of the server's +lib/+ directory with the contents of the +lib/+ directory of the updated package.
. Start the server

When using RPM distribution it is enough to update the package with your package manager and restart the server. 

[[ver-update]]
=== Version specific update instructions

[NOTE]
The last component in the version string is irrelevant for the following instructions. For instance instructions
for the 1.2.0->1.3.0 applies also to 1.2.0->1.3.1 and all other 1.3.x versions.

==== From 2.x to 2.y

Please check documentation of the 2.y version. Below we are only focused on Unity 3 updates. 

==== From 2.x to 3.0.0

===== No reloads by default upon restart from config files

This is new behavior in version 3. It can be turned off by adding:

-----
unityServer.core.useConfiguredContentsOnFreshStartOnly=false
-----

to +unityServer.conf+. It might be needed temporary when upgrading to load new config options, or when 
it is preferred to use config files to set up system in the Unity 2 way.    

===== Admin UI -> Admin Console

Admin UI is deprecated and will be removed in subsequent versions. It 
It is disabled in a default configuration file of Unity 3.0 and replaced by a new endpoint: Admin Console. 
By default it is exposed on a +/console+ path. It is strongly suggested to enable this endpoint in the upgraded system
and afterwards undeploy Admin UI.

Example configuration:

----
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.endpointType=WebConsoleUI
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.endpointConfigurationFile=${CONF}/modules/core/console.properties
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.contextPath=/console
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.endpointRealm=adminRealm
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.endpointName=UNITY console administration interface
unityServer.core.endpoints.consoleUI.endpointAuthenticators=pwd;cert
----

Note that above setting won't be picked up on upgraded system: see above for explanation and workaround. Another workaround
is to login to the legacy Admin UI, and deploy the Console endpoint from the System Management-> Endpoints tab.
Afterwards Admin UI can be dropped or used in parallel with Console.
